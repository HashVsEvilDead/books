Introduction
============

A simple yet revolutionary approach to improving your body's oxygen use, increasing your health, weight loss, and sports performance. One of the biggest obstacles to better health and fitness is a rarely identified problem: chronic over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we need (without realizing it) contributing to poor health and fitness, including a host of disorders, from anxiety and asthma to insomnia and heart problems.
In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000 people (including Olympic and professional athletes) in reduced breathing exercises now shares his techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) to determine how efficiently your body uses oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and professional athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss, and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve cardio-fitness.
