Introduction
============

A simple yet revolutionary approach to improving your body's oxygen use, increasing your health, weight loss, and sports performance. One of the biggest obstacles to better health and fitness is a rarely identified problem: chronic over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we need (without realizing it) contributing to poor health and fitness, including a host of disorders, from anxiety and asthma to insomnia and heart problems.
In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000 people (including Olympic and professional athletes) in reduced breathing exercises now shares his techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) to determine how efficiently your body uses oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and professional athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss, and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve cardio-fitness.

---------------------------

### The Oxygen Paradox
This chapter describes how CO2 is needed to deliver oxygen to the muscles. Oxygen saturation is always enough (95-99% in an healthy person). We need to increase the level of CO2 to maximize the delivery of oxygen. The level of CO2 is what triggers the stimulus to breathe. Overbreathing results in an increased sensitivity or lower tolerance to CO2.

### How Fit Are You Really? The Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT)
VO2 max is the maximum capacity of your body to transport and utilize oxygen in 1 minute during maximal or exhaustive exercise.
VO2 max is used to evaluate the capacity to sustain physical exercise together with running economy: that is the amount of energy or oxygen consumed while running at a speed that is less than maximum pace. Breath-hold training can improve both factors.
The Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) is a very useful and accurate tool for determining this relative breathing volume. The lower the BOLT score, the greater the breathing volume, and the greater your breathing volume, the more breathlessness you will experience during exercise. Here's the test:
1. Take a normal breath in through your nose and allow a normal breath out through your nose.
2. Hold your nose with your fingers to prevent air from entering your lungs.
3. Time the number of seconds until you feel the first definite desire to breathe, or the first stresses of your body urging you to breathe. These sensations may include the need to swallow or a constriction of the airways. You may also feel the first involuntary contractions of your breathing muscles in your abdomen or throat as the body gives the message to resume breathing. A score of 20 seconds is acceptable but the goal should be 40 seconds.

### Noses Are for Breathing, Mouths Are for Eating
In this chapter, the author lists the main benefits of nasal breathing and explains how to unblock the nose:
- Take a small, silent breath in through your nose and a small, silent breath out through your nose.
- Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold your breath.
- Walk as many paces as possible with your breath held. Try to build up a medium to strong air shortage, without overdoing it.
- When you resume breathing, do so only through your nose. Try to calm your breathing immediately.
- After resuming your breathing, your first breath will probably be bigger than normal. Make sure that you calm your breathing as soon as possible by suppressing our second and third breaths.
- You should be able to recover normal breathing within 2 or 3 breaths. If your breathing is erratic or heavier than usual, you have held your breath for too long.
- Wait 1 or 2 minutes before repeating the breath hold.
- In order to prepare yourself for the longer breath holds, go easy for the first few repetitions, increasing your paces each time.
- Repeat for a total of 6 breath holds, creating a fairly strong need for air.
Generally, this exercise will unblock the nose, even if you have a head cold. However, as soon as the effects of the breath hold wear off, the nose will likely feel blocked again. By gradually increasing the number of steps you can take with your breath held, you will find the results continue to improve. When you are able to walk a total of 80 paces with the breath held, your nose will remain decongested. Eighty paces is actually a very achievable goal, and you can expect to progress by an additional ten paces per week. By holding your breath, you sharply increase the concentration of nitric oxide in your nasal cavity, resulting in dilation of the nasal passages and smooth, easy nasal breathing once more.
To make sure that we breath through the nouse during sleep, you should tape your mouth with a 3M micropore tape.

### Breathe Light to Breathe Right
When we breathe too much over a period of hours to days, as in the case of chronic stress, the respiratory center adjusts to a lower tolerance of carbon dioxide. Having a lower than normal tolerance to carbon dioxide results in the respiratory center increasing the rate of impulses to the respiratory muscles. The result is habitual overbreathing and excess breathlessness during physical exercise. You are practicing this exercise correctly when you slow down and reduce your breathing sufficiently to create a tolerable need for air. The need for air signifies an accumulation of arterial carbon dioxide, the goal of which is to reset the respiratory center's tolerance to this gas. To assist with this, it is very helpful to exert gentle pressure against your chest and abdomen with your hands. Try to maintain the need for air for the duration of 4 to 5 minutes. To practice this exercise, it can be very helpful to sit in front of a mirror to observe and follow your breathing movements.
- Sit up straight. Allow your shoulders to relax. Imagine a piece of string gently holding you up from the top of the back of your head. At the same time, feel the space between your ribs gradually widening.
- Place one hand on your chest and one hand just above your navel.
- Feel your abdomen gently moving outward as you inhale and gently moving inward as you exhale.
- As you breathe, exert gentle pressure with your hands against your abdomen and chest. This should create resistance to your breathing.
- Breathe against your hands, concentrating on making the size of each breath smaller.
- With each breath, take in less air than you would like to. Make the in-breath smaller or shorter.
- Gently slow down and reduce your breathing movements until you feel a tolerable hunger for air.
- Breathe out with a relaxed exhalation. Allow the natural elasticity of your lungs and diaphragm to play their role in each exhalation. Imagine a balloon slowly and gently deflating of its own accord.
- When the in-breath becomes smaller and the out-breath is relaxed, visible breathing movements will be reduced. You may be able to notice this in a mirror.
By using a simple exercise like this, you can reduce your breathing movements by 20 to 30 percent. If your stomach muscles start to contract or jerk or feel tense, or if your breathing rhythm becomes disrupted or out of control, then the air shortage is too intense. In this situation, abandon the exercise for 15 seconds or so and return to it when the air shortage has disappeared.
At first, you may only be able to maintain an air shortage for 20 seconds before the urge to breathe is too strong. With practice, you will be able to maintain an air shortage for longer periods. Remember, you are trying to create an air shortage that is tolerable but not stressful. Aim to maintain this tolerable “air hunger” for 3 to 5 minutes at a time. Practicing 2 sets of 5-minute exercises is enough to help you reset your breathing center and improve your body’s tolerance for carbon dioxide.

### Secrets of Ancient Tribes
Warm-up:
- Begin walking at a pace that is comfortable for you.
- During your warm-up, try to breathe regularly and calmly through your nose, using your diaphragm to maintain a gentle and relaxed breathing technique.
- Feel your abdomen gently moving outward as you inhale and gently moving inward as you exhale.
- As you walk, allow a feeling of relaxation to spread throughout your body. Silently encourage the area around your chest and abdomen to relax (you will find that any tension can be released by silently telling that area of the body to relax). Feel your body relax and become soft. Body relaxation during physical exercise helps to ensure steady, calm, and regular breathing.
- After 1 minute or so of walking at a fairly good pace, exhale normally through your nose and pinch your nose with your fingers to hold the breath. (If you are in a public place, you might prefer to hold the breath without holding your nose.)
- While holding your breath, walk for 10 to 30 paces, or until you feel a moderate need to breathe. When you feel this hunger for air, let go of your nose and resume breathing through your nose.
- Continue walking for 10 minutes, performing a breath hold every minute or so.
Recovery breathing (3-5 minutes):
- Exhale as normal through the nose.
- Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold the breath for 2 to 5 seconds.
- Breathe normally through the nose for 10 seconds.
- Repeat the first 3 steps throughout your cooldown.
- Resume regular breathing.
Checking if you have exercised correctly:
- Measure your BOLT score before training.
- Perform your physical exercise.
- Measure your BOLT score one hour after you finish training.
- If your BOLT score is higher after exercise than before, your breathing is efficient during exercise.
- If your BOLT score is lower after exercise than before, your breathing is inefficient during exercise and you need to slow down.

### Gaining the edge naturally
This sections explains how breath-holding simulates many of the positive benefits of high-altitude and high-intensity training.

### Bring the Mountain to You
Breath holding during walking:
After a minute of walking, exhale and hold your breath until you feel a medium to strong air shortage. After inhaling, minimize your breathing by taking very short breaths for about 15 seconds. Then allow your breathing to return to normal. Continue walking for 30 seconds and repeat 8 to 10 times.
Breath holding during running or cycling:
Run or ride your bike for 15 minutes, exhale and hold your breath until you feel a medium to strong air shortage. Break for 1 minute and repeat 8 to 10 times.
Breath holding during swimming:
Gradually increase the number of strokes between breaths from 3 to 5 to 7.

### Finding the zone
By following the breath and bringing attention to the inner body, we are able to bring our attention to the present moment.
You shouldn't do it only during meditation; you should do it throughout the day. Whenever you find your mind ruminating about an upcoming event, immediately bring your attention to your breath or inner body.
Breathing exercise to calm down:
- Take a small, silent breath in and out through your nose
- Hold your breath for 2 to 5 seconds
- After each breath hold, breathe normally for around 10 seconds. Do not interfere with your breathing
- Continue to do a small breath hold followed by normal breathing for around 10 seconds
- Practice this exercise for at least 15 minutes.

### Rapid Weight Loss Without Dieting
One of the benefits of breathing correctly, it's weight loss. Here's a routine that helped a patient losing weight:
- Perform 10 minutes of Breathe Light to Breathe Right (page 74), 4 times per day, with 1 session just before bed and 1 just after waking
- Stop and observe the breath for 1 to 2 minutes at various times throughout the day to further reduce overthinking
- Tape the mouth closed before retiring to sleep to ensure nasal breathing at night
- Practice the Breathing Recovery Exercise (page 91) whenever he felt anxious or stressed
- Walk with the mouth closed for 30 minutes daily
- Pay attention to appetite and eat only when hungry
- Reduce alcohol consumption to no more than 2 servings of alcohol each night for the first week. From week 2, reduce drinking to every other night.

Part IV: Your Oxygen Advantage Program
---------------------------

### Oxygen Advantage Exercise Summary

#### Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT)
1. Take a small breath in through your nose and a small breath out
2. Hold your nose with your fingers
3. Count the number of seconds until you feel the first definite desire to breathe (your abdomen may jerk and the area around your neck may contract)

A good BOLT score should be at least 20 seconds but you should aim to 40 seconds.

#### Nose Unblocking Exercise
1. Take a small breath in through your nose and a small breath out
2. Hold your nose with your fingers
3. Walk as many paces as possible
4. When you resume breathing, do so only through your nose; you should be able to recover your breath within 2 to 3 breaths. If you cannot, you have held your breath for too long
5. Wait for about a minute or so and then repeat 5 or 6 times until the nose is decongested

#### Breathe Light to Breathe Right
1. Place one hand on your chest and the other just above your navel
2. Breathe in and gently guide your abdomen outward
3. Breathe out and gently guide your abdomen inward
4. Apply gentle pressure with your hands to slightly reduce your breathing movements; it should feel as if you are breathing against your hands
5. Take in a smaller or shorter breath than you would like
6. Allow a relaxed breath out, exhaling gently, slowly, and easily
7. Do not tense your body, hold your breath, or pause your breathing; the objective is to create a tolerable hunger for air.
8. Try to sustain this for 3 to 5 minutes at a time

#### Breathing Recovery, Improved Concentration
1. Exhale as normal through the nose
2. Hold your nose with your fingers for 2 to 5 seconds
3. Breathe normally through the nose for 10 seconds
4. Repeat the first three steps for 3 to 5 minutes

#### Simulate High-Altitude Training - Walking
1. Walk for 1 minute or so while breathing through your nose
2. Hold your breath until you feel a medium hunger for air
3. Minimize your breathing for 15 seconds by taking short breaths
4. Resume normal breathing for 30 seconds and repeat 8 to 10 times

A typical increase in the number of paces per breath hold might look like this: 20, 20, 30, 35, 42, 47, 53, 60, 60, 55.

#### Simulate High-Altitude Training - Running and cycling
1. 10 to 15 minutes into your training, gently exhale and hold your breath until a strong air shortage is reached
2. Recover your breath for 1 minute
3. Repeat 8 to 10 times. The breath hold should be a challenge and, at the same time, should allow breathing to recover to normal within a couple of breaths

#### Simulate High-Altitude Training - Swimming
During swimming, increase the number of strokes between breaths. You can do this in gradual increments, increasing the number of strokes between breaths from 3 to 5 to 7 over a series of lengths.

#### Advanced Simulation of High-Altitude Training
1. Walk for a minute or so. Exhale and hold your breath for approximately 40 paces, then take a tiny breath, just enough to reduce tension. Hold the breath for a further 10 paces
2. Now take a sip of air in or out of the lungs. Hold for 10 paces or so
3. Continue taking sips of air and repeating short breath holds until you feel a fairly strong air shortage
4. Challenge but do not stress yourself
5. Perform this exercise for 1 to 2 minutes

General Program Based on BOLT and Health
---------------------------

### BOLT < 10s
1. Measure your BOLT score each morning after waking
2. Breathe through the nose both day and night (wear paper tape across your lips during sleep)
3. Practice the Breathing Recovery Exercise throughout the day, ideally spending 10 minutes 6 times per day doing small breath holds of between 2 and 5 seconds
4. Another option to help recover breathing is to exhale through your nose, pinch your nose with your fingers, and walk while holding the breath for 5 to 10 paces. Rest for 1 minute and repeat 10 times.
5. Engage in 10 to 15 minutes of slow walking each day with the mouth closed. If you need to breathe through your mouth, you must stop walking to recover your breath.
6. Your expected progress is to increase your BOLT score to 25 seconds within 6 to 8 weeks

### 10s <= BOLT < 20s
1. Measure your BOLT score each morning after waking
2. Breathe through the nose both day and night (wear paper tape across your lips during sleep)

6. After physical exercise, practice the Breathing Recovery Exercise
7. Reduce breathing using the Breathe Light to Breathe Right exercise for 15 minutes last thing at night

Conclusion
==========

The book could have been shrunk to the last chapter containing the summary of the different techniques and the program based on your current situation. An even more synthetic summary could be: breathe less, through your nose, with your abdomen. I would suggest the book because breathing control is a mandatory tool to have.
