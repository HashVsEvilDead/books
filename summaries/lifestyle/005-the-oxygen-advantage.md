Introduction
============

A simple yet revolutionary approach to improving your body's oxygen use, increasing your health, weight loss, and sports performance. One of the biggest obstacles to better health and fitness is a rarely identified problem: chronic over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we need (without realizing it) contributing to poor health and fitness, including a host of disorders, from anxiety and asthma to insomnia and heart problems.
In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000 people (including Olympic and professional athletes) in reduced breathing exercises now shares his techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) to determine how efficiently your body uses oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and professional athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss, and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve cardio-fitness.

#### The Oxygen Paradox
This chapter describes how CO2 is needed to deliver oxygen to the muscles. Oxygen saturation is always enough (95-99% in an healthy person). We need to increase the level of CO2 to maximize the delivery of oxygen. The level of CO2 is what triggers the stimulus to breathe. Overbreathing results in an increased sensitivity or lower tolerance to CO2.

#### How Fit Are You Really? The Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT)
VO2 max is the maximum capacity of your body to transport and utilize oxygen in 1 minute during maximal or exhaustive exercise.
VO2 max is used to evaluate the capacity to sustain physical exercise together with running economy: that is the amount of energy or oxygen consumed while running at a speed that is less than maximum pace. Breath-hold training can improve both factors.
The Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) is a very useful and accurate tool for determining this relative breathing volume. The lower the BOLT score, the greater the breathing volume, and the greater your breathing volume, the more breathlessness you will experience during exercise. Here's the test:
1. Take a normal breath in through your nose and allow a normal breath out through your nose.
2. Hold your nose with your fingers to prevent air from entering your lungs.
3. Time the number of seconds until you feel the first definite desire to breathe, or the first stresses of your body urging you to breathe. These sensations may include the need to swallow or a constriction of the airways. You may also feel the first involuntary contractions of your breathing muscles in your abdomen or throat as the body gives the message to resume breathing.

#### Noses Are for Breathing, Mouths Are for Eating
In this chapter, the author lists the main benefits of nasal breathing and explains how to unblock the nose:
- Take a small, silent breath in through your nose and a small, silent breath out through your nose.
- Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold your breath.
- Walk as many paces as possible with your breath held. Try to build up a medium to strong air shortage, without overdoing it.
- When you resume breathing, do so only through your nose. Try to calm your breathing immediately.
- After resuming your breathing, your first breath will probably be bigger than normal. Make sure that you calm your breathing as soon as possible by suppressing our second and third breaths.
- You should be able to recover normal breathing within 2 or 3 breaths. If your breathing is erratic or heavier than usual, you have held your breath for too long.
- Wait 1 or 2 minutes before repeating the breath hold.
- In order to prepare yourself for the longer breath holds, go easy for the first few repetitions, increasing your paces each time.
- Repeat for a total of 6 breath holds, creating a fairly strong need for air.
Generally, this exercise will unblock the nose, even if you have a head cold. However, as soon as the effects of the breath hold wear off, the nose will likely feel blocked again. By gradually increasing the number of steps you can take with your breath held, you will find the results continue to improve. When you are able to walk a total of 80 paces with the breath held, your nose will remain decongested. Eighty paces is actually a very achievable goal, and you can expect to progress by an additional ten paces per week. By holding your breath, you sharply increase the concentration of nitric oxide in your nasal cavity, resulting in dilation of the nasal passages and smooth, easy nasal breathing once more.
To make sure that we breath through the nouse during sleep, you should tape your mouth with a 3M micropore tape.

#### Breathe Light to Breathe Right
When we breathe too much over a period of hours to days, as in the case of chronic stress, the respiratory center adjusts to a lower tolerance of carbon dioxide. Having a lower than normal tolerance to carbon dioxide results in the respiratory center increasing the rate of impulses to the respiratory muscles. The result is habitual overbreathing and excess breathlessness during physical exercise. You are practicing this exercise correctly when you slow down and reduce your breathing sufficiently to create a tolerable need for air. The need for air signifies an accumulation of arterial carbon dioxide, the goal of which is to reset the respiratory center's tolerance to this gas. To assist with this, it is very helpful to exert gentle pressure against your chest and abdomen with your hands. Try to maintain the need for air for the duration of 4 to 5 minutes. To practice this exercise, it can be very helpful to sit in front of a mirror to observe and follow your breathing movements.
- Sit up straight. Allow your shoulders to relax. Imagine a piece of string gently holding you up from the top of the back of your head. At the same time, feel the space between your ribs gradually widening.
- Place one hand on your chest and one hand just above your navel.
- Feel your abdomen gently moving outward as you inhale and gently moving inward as you exhale.
- As you breathe, exert gentle pressure with your hands against your abdomen and chest. This should create resistance to your breathing.
- Breathe against your hands, concentrating on making the size of each breath smaller.
- With each breath, take in less air than you would like to. Make the in-breath smaller or shorter.
- Gently slow down and reduce your breathing movements until you feel a tolerable hunger for air.
- Breathe out with a relaxed exhalation. Allow the natural elasticity of your lungs and diaphragm to play their role in each exhalation. Imagine a balloon slowly and gently deflating of its own accord.
- When the in-breath becomes smaller and the out-breath is relaxed, visible breathing movements will be reduced. You may be able to notice this in a mirror.
By using a simple exercise like this, you can reduce your breathing movements by 20 to 30 percent. If your stomach muscles start to contract or jerk or feel tense, or if your breathing rhythm becomes disrupted or out of control, then the air shortage is too intense. In this situation, abandon the exercise for 15 seconds or so and return to it when the air shortage has disappeared.
At first, you may only be able to maintain an air shortage for 20 seconds before the urge to breathe is too strong. With practice, you will be able to maintain an air shortage for longer periods. Remember, you are trying to create an air shortage that is tolerable but not stressful. Aim to maintain this tolerable “air hunger” for 3 to 5 minutes at a time. Practicing 2 sets of 5-minute exercises is enough to help you reset your breathing center and improve your body’s tolerance for carbon dioxide.

#### Secrets of Ancient Tribes
Warm-up:
- Begin walking at a pace that is comfortable for you.
- During your warm-up, try to breathe regularly and calmly through your nose, using your diaphragm to maintain a gentle and relaxed breathing technique.
- Feel your abdomen gently moving outward as you inhale and gently moving inward as you exhale.
- As you walk, allow a feeling of relaxation to spread throughout your body. Silently encourage the area around your chest and abdomen to relax (you will find that any tension can be released by silently telling that area of the body to relax). Feel your body relax and become soft. Body relaxation during physical exercise helps to ensure steady, calm, and regular breathing.
- After 1 minute or so of walking at a fairly good pace, exhale normally through your nose and pinch your nose with your fingers to hold the breath. (If you are in a public place, you might prefer to hold the breath without holding your nose.)
- While holding your breath, walk for 10 to 30 paces, or until you feel a moderate need to breathe. When you feel this hunger for air, let go of your nose and resume breathing through your nose.
- Continue walking for 10 minutes, performing a breath hold every minute or so.
Recovery breathing (3-5 minutes):
- Exhale as normal through the nose.
- Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold the breath for 2 to 5 seconds.
- Breathe normally through the nose for 10 seconds.
- Repeat the first 3 steps throughout your cooldown.
- Resume regular breathing.
Checking if you have exercised correctly:
- Measure your BOLT score before training.
- Perform your physical exercise.
- Measure your BOLT score one hour after you finish training.
- If your BOLT score is higher after exercise than before, your breathing is efficient during exercise.
- If your BOLT score is lower after exercise than before, your breathing is inefficient during exercise and you need to slow down.
