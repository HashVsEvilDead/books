Author
------------
George Pólya (December 13, 1887 – July 9th, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory. He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education.


Introduction
============

In this book, Pólya provides general heuristics for solving basically any kind of problems, including both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The book includes advice for teaching students of mathematics and a mini-encyclopedia of heuristic terms. The author suggests the following steps when solving a problem:
- First, you have to understand the problem.
- After understanding, make a plan.
- Carry out the plan.
- Look back on your work. How could it be better?

If this technique fails, Pólya advises:
> If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.

Or

> If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?

Conclusion
==========
Your conclusion should wrap up by reviewing the main points of the book and giving your opinion of the book. Did you like it? Was it enjoyable? Do you agree with the author’s ideas or ways of writing? Did you learn something you didn’t know before? Explain your reasons for your reaction, using examples to support your claims.

Questions to ask myself:

* Is the title accurate and fit the knowledge level of the material presented?
* What level of experience is needed to effectively use the book?
* What are the key strengths and weaknesses of the book?
* Who will find the book most useful?
* Is the book technically accurate?
* How clearly is the material presented?
* Are the tables, figures / illustrations appropriate and well executed?
* Is the depth appropriate for the stated audience?
* Is the material new or present a different approach, or is it a rehash of existing texts?

Imagine your conclusion as a way of telling others whether they should read the book or not. Would they enjoy it? Should they read it? Why or why not?
