Author
------------
George Pólya (December 13, 1887 – July 9th, 1985) was a Hungarian mathematician. He was a professor of mathematics from 1914 to 1940 at ETH Zürich and from 1940 to 1953 at Stanford University. He made fundamental contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis and probability theory. He is also noted for his work in heuristics and mathematics education.


Introduction
============

In this book, Pólya provides general heuristics for solving basically any kind of problems, including both mathematical and non-mathematical problems. The book includes advice for teaching students of mathematics and a mini-encyclopedia of heuristic terms. The author suggests the following steps when solving a problem:
- First, you have to understand the problem.
- After understanding, make a plan.
- Carry out the plan.
- Look back on your work. How could it be better?

If this technique fails, Pólya advises:
> If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.

Or

> If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?

Part I - In the classroom
---------------------------
There 4 phases when trying to solve a problem and each one of them has a set of questions that can help you in finding a solution. First, we have to understand the problem; we have to see clearly what is required. Second, we have to see how the various items are connected, how the unknown is linked to the data, in order to obtain the idea of the solution, to make a plan. Third, we carry out our plan. Fourth, we look back at the completed solution, we review and discuss it.

### 1. Understand the problem

You have to understand the problem.
- **What is the unknown?**
- **What are the data?**
- **What is the condition?**
- **Is it possible to satisfy the condition?**
- **Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or contradictory?**
- **Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation. Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down?**

Example: finding the diagonal of a parallelepiped. The dialogue between the teacher and the students may start as follows:
- "What is the unknown?"
- "The length of the diagonal of a parallelepiped."
- "What are the data?"
- "The length, the width, and the height of the parallelepiped."
- "Introduce suitable notation. Which letter should denote the unknown?"
- "x."
- "Which letters would you choose for the length, the width, and the height?"
- "a, b, c."
- "What is the condition, linking a, b, c, and x?"
- "x is the diagonal of the parallelepiped of which a, b, and c are the length, the width, and the height."
- "Is it a reasonable problem? I mean, is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?"
- "Yes, it is. If we know a, b, c, we know the parallelepiped. If the parallelepiped is determined, the diagonal is determined."

### 2. Devising a plan

Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found.
- **Have you seen it before? Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?**
- **Do you know a related problem? Do you know a theorem that could be useful?**
- **Look at the unknown! Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it? Could you use its result? Could you use its method? Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?**
- **Could you restate the problem? Could you restate it still differently? Go back to definitions.**
- **If you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? A more general problem? A more special problem? An analogous problem? Could you solve a part of the problem? Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; how far is the unknown then determined, how can it vary? Could you derive something useful from the data? Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown? Could you change the unknown or the data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?**

The way from understanding the problem to conceiving a plan may be long and tortuous. In fact, the main achievement in the solution of a problem is to conceive the idea of a plan. Let's start with a simple suggestion: **Look at the unknown! And try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown**. Sometimes, finding a similar (and already resolved) problem can lead to a solution but it doesn't happen all the time: **if you cannot solve the proposed problem try to solve first some related problem**. Experimenting with various auxiliary problems, we may stray far from our original problem but there is a good question that may bring us back to it: **Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition?**

Example: again finding the diagonal of a parallelepiped (dots are indicating silence).
- "Do you know a related problem?"
- ". . . . ."
- "Look at the unknown! Do you know a problem having the same unknown?"
- ". . . . ."
- "Well, what is the unknown?"
- "The diagonal of a parallelepiped."
- "Do you know any problem with the same unknown?"
- "No. We have not had any problem yet about the diagonal of a parallelepiped."
- "Do you know any problem with a similar unknown?"
. . . . .
- "You see, the diagonal is a segment, the segment of a straight line. Did you never solve a problem whose unknown was the length of a line?"
- "Of course, we have solved such problems. For instance, to find a side of a right triangle."
- "Good! Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it?"
- "Yes! The diagonal of a parallelepiped is the hypotenuse of the right triangle which one leg is the given height c and the other leg is the diagonal of a face"

### 3. Carrying out the plan

Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step.
- **Can you see clearly that the step is correct?**
- **Can you prove that it is correct?**

To devise a plan, to conceive the idea of the solution is not easy. It takes so much to succeed; formerly acquired knowledge, good mental habits, concentration upon the purpose, and one more thing: good luck. To carry out the plan is much easier; what we need is mainly patience.
The plan gives a general outline; we have to convince ourselves that the details fit into the outline, and so we have to examine the details one after the other, patiently, till everything is perfectly clear, and no obscure corner remains in which an error could be hidden.

### 4. Looking back

Examine the solution obtained.
- **Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?**
- **Can you derive the result differently? Can you see it at a glance?**
- **Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?**

By looking back at the completed solution, by reconsidering and reexamining the result and the path that led to it, we could consolidate our knowledge and **develop our ability to solve problems**. Errors are always possible, especially if the argument is long and involved. Hence, verifications are desirable. **Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?**
We have a natural opportunity to investigate the connections of a problem when looking back at its solution and to find some general principles. We should try to imagine cases in which we could utilize again the procedure used, or apply the result obtained. **Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?**

Example: we found that the diagonal of a parallelepiped is sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
- "Our problem is a problem of solid geometry: to find the diagonal of a parallelepiped with given dimensions a, b, c. Our problem is analogous to a problem of plane geometry: to find the diagonal of a rectangle with given dimensions a, b. Is the result of our _solid_ problem analogous to the result of the _plane_ problem?"
- "If the height c decreases, and finally vanishes, the parallelepiped becomes a parallelogram. If you put c = 0 in your formula, do you obtain the correct formula for the diagonal of the rectangular parallelogram?"
- "If the height c increases, the diagonal increases. Does your formula show this?"
- "If all three measures a, b, c of the parallelepiped increase in the same proportion, the diagonal also increases in the same proportion. If, in your formula, you substitute 12a, 12b, 12c for a, b, c respectively, the expression of the diagonal, owing to this substitution, should also be multiplied by 12. Is that so?"
- "If a, b, c are measured in feet, your formula gives the diagonal measured in feet too; but if you change all measures into inches, the formula should remain correct. Is that so?"

These questions have several good effects. First, an intelligent student cannot help being impressed by the fact that the formula passes so many tests. He was convinced before that the formula is correct because he derived it carefully. But now he is more convinced, and his gain in confidence comes from a different source; it is due to a sort of “experimental evidence.” Then, thanks to the foregoing questions, the details of the formula acquire new significance, and are linked up with various facts. The formula has therefore a better chance of being remembered, the knowledge of the student is consolidated. Finally, these questions can be easily transferred to similar problems. After some experience with similar problems, an intelligent student may perceive the underlying general ideas: use of all relevant data, variation of the data, symmetry, analogy. If he gets into the habit of directing his attention to such points, his ability to solve problems may definitely profit.
